    Fallbrook Recreation Center is the home to many events and can be rented and used for a variety of occasions outside of the regular recreational activities. Activities such as hiking or skiing do not require a reservation, but use of the lodging and other facilities do.
    Generally, the Ski Lodge is available by reservation only from 7AM to Midnight and the barn is only open from April 16th to October 31st at the same hours.<br><br>

    If you would like to rent the area for wedding services the cost is $400 total for 4 hours with a required $200 reservation fee and can be made one year in advance.<br><br>

    To reserve any event please call SUNY Oswegoâ€™s Auxiliary Services at <a href="tel:3153123670">315.312.3670</a> or email <a href="mailto:nathan.little@oswego.edu">nathan.little@oswego.edu</a>.
